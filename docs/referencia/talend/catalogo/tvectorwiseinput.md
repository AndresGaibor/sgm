# tVectorWiseInput

Executes a DB query with a strictly defined order which must correspond to the schema definition.

tVectorWiseInput reads a database and extracts fields based on a query. It passes on the field list to the next component via a Main row link.

Information noteNote:

* This component is available only when you have installed the 8.0.1-R2023-02 Talend Studio Monthly update or a later one delivered by Talend. For more information, check with your administrator.
* If you plan to upgrade from an earlier version of Talend Studio that has Vectorwise components, please make sure you apply the 8.0.1-R2023-02 Talend Studio Monthly update before starting the upgrade process.

## tVectorWiseInput Standard properties

These properties are used to configure tVectorWiseInput running in the Standard Job framework.

The Standard tVectorWiseInput component belongs to the Databases family.

The component in this framework is available in all Talend products.

Information noteNote: This component is a specific version of a dynamic database connector. The properties related to database settings vary depending on your database type selection. For more information about dynamic database connectors, see [DB Generic components](https://help.qlik.com/talend/r/en-US/8.0/components/db-generic/db-generic-component).

## Basic settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Database | Select the desired database type from the list and click<br>Apply. |
| Property type | <ul> <li> <p> <span>Either <span>Built-in</span> or										<span>Repository</span> </span>.</p> </li> <li> <p> <span>Built-in</span>: No property data stored								centrally.</p> </li> <li> <p> <span>Repository</span>: Select the repository								file where Properties are stored. The fields that follow are								completed automatically using the data retrieved.</p> </li> </ul> |
| ![](https://help.qlik.com/talend/en-US/components/Resources/images/Save_Icon.png) | Click this icon to open a database connection wizard and store the<br>database connection parameters you set in the component Basic settings view.<br><br>For more information about setting up and storing database<br>connection parameters, see [Centralizing database metadata](https://help.qlik.com/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/centralizing-database-metadata). |
| Use an existing connection | Select this check box and in the Component<br>List drop-down list, select the desired connection component to<br>reuse the connection details you already defined.<br><br>Information noteNote: When a Job contains the parent Job and the child Job, do the following if you<br>want to share an existing connection between the parent Job and the child Job (for example,<br>to share the connection created by the parent Job with the child Job).<br><br><ol> <li>In the parent level, register the database connection to be shared               in the <span>Basic settings</span> view of the               connection component which creates that very database connection. </li> <li>In the child level, use a dedicated connection component to read               that registered database connection. </li> </ol><br><br>For an example about how to share a database connection across Job levels,<br>see [Sharing a database connection](https://help.qlik.com/talend/r/en-US/7.3/studio-user-guide/sharing-database-connection). |
| Server | Database server IP address. |
| Port | Listening port number of the DB server. |
| Database | Name of the database. |
| Username and<br>Password | Authentication information of the database user.<br><br>To enter the password, click the [...] button<br>next to the password field, enter the password in double quotes in the pop-up dialog box,<br>and click OK to save the settings. |
| Schema and Edit<br>Schema | <ul> <li> <p>A schema is a row description. It defines the number of fields            (columns) to be processed and passed on to the next component. When you create a Spark            Job, avoid the reserved word <kbd>line</kbd> when naming the            fields.</p> <p>This component offers the advantage of the                  dynamic schema feature. This allows you to retrieve unknown columns from source                  files or to copy batches of columns from a source without mapping each column                  individually. For further information about dynamic schemas, see <a href="https://help.qlik.com/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/dynamic-schema" target="_blank">Dynamic schema</a>.</p> <p>This            dynamic schema feature is designed for the purpose of retrieving unknown columns of a            table and is recommended to be used for this purpose only; it is not recommended for the            use of creating tables.</p> </li> <li> <p> <span>Built-In</span>: You create and store the schema locally for this component                only.</p> </li> <li> <p> <span>Repository</span>: You have already created the schema and stored it in the                Repository. You can reuse it in various projects and Job designs.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click <span>Edit        schema</span> to make changes to the schema. If the current schema is of the <span>Repository</span> type, three options are available:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <span>View schema</span>: choose this                option to view the schema only.</p> </li> <li> <p> <span>Change to built-in property</span>:                choose this option to change the schema to <span>Built-in</span> for local changes.</p> </li> <li> <p> <span>Update repository connection</span>:                choose this option to change the schema stored in the repository and decide whether                to propagate the changes to all the Jobs upon completion.</p> <p>If you just want to                propagate the changes to the current Job, you can select <span>No</span> upon completion and choose this schema metadata                again in the <span>Repository Content</span>                window.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> |
| Table name | Name of the table to be read. |
| Query type and<br>Query | Enter your DB query, ensuring that the field order matches the<br>order in the schema.<br><br><br>*If using the dynamic schema feature, the SELECT<br>query must include the \*<br>wildcard, to retrieve all of the columns from the table<br>selected.* |
| Guess Query | Click this button to generate a query that corresponds to your<br>table schema in the Query<br>field. |
| Guess schema | Click this button to retrieve the schema from the table. |

## Advanced settings

| Properties | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Additional JDBC Parameters | Specify additional JDBC parameters for the database connection created.<br><br>This property is not available when the Use an existing connection check box in the Basic<br>settings view is selected. |
| Trim all the String/Char columns | Select this check box to remove leading and trailing whitespace<br>from all the String/Char columns. |
| Trim column | Define columns from which to remove leading and trailing<br>whitespace. |
| tStat<br>Catcher Statistics | Select this check box to collect log data at the component<br>level. |

## Global Variables

| Variables | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Global Variables | NB\_LINE:<br>the number of rows processed. This is an After variable and it returns an integer.<br><br><br>QUERY: the query statement<br>being processed. This is a Flow variable and it returns a string.<br><br><br>ERROR\_MESSAGE: the error message generated by the<br>component when an error occurs. This is an After variable and it returns a string. This<br>variable functions only if the Die on error checkbox is<br>cleared, if the component has this checkbox.<br><br>A Flow variable functions during the execution of a component<br>while an After variable functions after the execution of the component.<br><br>To fill up a field or expression with a variable, press Ctrl+Space to access the variable list and choose the variable to use from<br>it.<br><br>For more information about variables, see [Using contexts and variables](https://help.qlik.com/talend/r/en-US/8.0/studio-user-guide/contexts-and-variables). |
